# STOCK PRICE PREDICTION AND FORECASTING
 Stock Price Prediction and Forecasting project uses past stock data to build models that try to guess future stock prices. we have used  use math, LSTM and  machine learning to find patterns and make educated predictions. It's all about analyzing the past to anticipate the future in the stock market.

## Key takeaways
Important Points 

 -Historical Data Analysis: Examining past price trends, trading volumes, and other relevant indicators to identify patterns.
 
 -Model Building: Selecting and training a prediction model.
 
 -Backtesting: Evaluating the model's performance on historical data.
 
 -Performance Metrics: Using metrics like Mean absolute  Error (MAE) 
 
## Technology used 
Python: Main programming language for the project.

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for coding and analysis.

Matplotlib: For creating plots and visualizations of stock data and predictions.

NumPy: For efficient numerical calculations on stock market data.

Pandas: For organizing, cleaning, and analyzing stock data using DataFrames.

TensorFlow: For building and training advanced machine learning models (like neural networks) for prediction.
